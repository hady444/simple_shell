## Introduction

The ALX Simple Shell Project is a minimalist shell implementation written in C for educational purposes. It mimics basic functionalities of a Unix shell, providing a command-line interface for users to interact with the underlying operating system.

## Features

- Simple command execution using system calls
- Basic shell built-ins (exit, env)

## Getting Started

To get started with the ALX Simple Shell Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-simple-shell.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd alx-simple-shell
    ```

3. Compile the shell:

    ```bash
    gcc -o simple_shell *.c
    ```

## Usage

Once the compilation is successful, you can run the simple shell using the following command:

```bash
./simple_shell
```

The shell will start, and you can enter commands as you would in a typical Unix shell.
